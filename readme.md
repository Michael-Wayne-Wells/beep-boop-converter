#### By _**Michael Wells**_

## Description

_This program takes a number input from a user and returns numbers counting up until it reaches the user's number. It then will convert any number with a '3' into "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that". If there are not threes in the number it will return "boop!" if there are any '2''s or a "beep!" for a one if there there is now a "3" or "2". Once submitted, the results will show on the page along with a button that will reverse the order of the returned result._
